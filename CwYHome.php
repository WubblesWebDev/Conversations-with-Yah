							<h3>How It Began</h3>
							<p>The day after my third grandson’s bris, I felt a need to start a fast.  I have fasted a number of times in my life and had even done several 40 day “juice” fasts.
							These have generally left me feeling better physically, (and lighter) but this one was different, in that after just about a week I switched over to a plain water fast.  Something I had never done for more than a few days, in the past.</p>
							<p>On the 36th day of this fast, I started hearing what seemed to be a conversation in my head.  This conversation seemed profound enough to me that I wanted to write it down.  All I had in my car was a pack of 3 inch post-it notes.  I wrote as legibly as I could; writing on a post-it note while driving my car.  Afterword, I thought, “that’s cool, I wonder where that came from”; but did not really expect that much of it.
							The next day, the same thing happened again, getting even more, actually filling up quite a few post-it notes.
							This continued for a few days and I began to feel like Yah was trying to say something to me.  At this time it occurred to me, “I need to get a bigger pad”.</p>
							<p>My drive to work is on an all 4-lane country highway, but even with that I began to worry about the safety of driving and writing at the same time. Even though I was keeping my eyes on the road as I wrote, keeping my pen on the pad and changing pages required me to look away, from time to time.  For this reason, I built a small writing desk over the console of my car, so that my writing pad was in a position that distracted very little from my driving.
							(With that said, I do not condone writing while driving.  This could easily be unsafe, but I felt that I was being protected and never had an accident while I was doing it.  If I hadn’t felt like I was getting messages from my creator, I wouldn’t have done it.) </p>
							<p>In reading these conversations, you may get a sense that all of it just flowed. This is not the case, as there were often interruptions, ponderings, and even outright halts.  In every case, I went through the (barely legible) scribblings that I had received while conversing.  I then took the time to form them into a more coherent fashion.

							<h3>The Names</h3>
							<p>In these conversations you will note that I use the Hebrew names for the heavenly Father, and his Son. (even at times, His Spirit)
							</p>
							<p><b>Yahuwah:</b>Several decades ago I discovered that the original names had been removed from the Christian bibles.  In Hebrew, the name that the creator of the universe gave for himself (Exodus 3:15) is I AM, which in Hebrew is hâyâh <b>היה</b>.  The more complete form of this is Yahuwah <b>הוהי</b>, which you often find abbreviated with the English letters, YAHUWAH.  
							Out of respect, I choose to call Him by the name which he uses for himself, although I often use the shortened version which is simply Yah.
							In the King James Version this name was removed and replaced it with a scheme for using the word LORD, all in caps.  I prefer to not use the word Lord, because it merely means “a master”.  A man may have many masters and the word actually directly translates to the Hebrew word “Baal” (false god) from the Old Testament. 
							</p>
							<p><b>Yahushua:</b> In the same way, our savior’s name has been rendered as Jesus.  He was a Hebrew so had the Hebrew name Yahushua, <b>עוּשׁוהי</b>. This literally means the salvation of Yahuwah, and is the same name of the Israelite that brought the tribes into the Promised Land.
							In the New Testament, an attempt was made to transliterate this into the Greek with Iēsous, which is as close as you get in Greek. (being as Greek does not have an “sh” sound)
							I am not exactly sure why the name Jesus ever came into use.  It obviously does not come from ancient texts, being as the letter “j” only became a letter in the year 1524.  In actuality, even the original King James Version used <u>Ieosus</u> and not <u>Jesus</u>.</p>
							<p><b>El/Elohim:</b>El is the Hebrew word for “mighty one”, and can even refer to a person, such as a judge or warrior.  When you find Lord (not in all caps) or God in your Bible that is the original Hebrew word that would have been used.
							Elohim is the plural of El, literally meaning “mighty ones”.  It is interesting to note that the Bible refers to our creator as Elohim. Genesis 1:1 says, “In the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.”  So it was a plural-being that created us. (Duality, Trinity?)
							</p>
							<p><b>Preference not dictum</b>My use of these Hebrew names are my preference and I am in no way trying to say that everyone needs to do as I do, or that you are wrong if you don’t.  Yet considering the number of times that the Scriptures tells us to do things in His Name, I prefer to do it as close to the original as possible.
							The Scriptures also tells us not to call upon Him with heathen names. (Exodus 23:13)
							I would recommend to anyone, if you so desire, to try using these names for yourself and see if it doesn’t help to make you feel closer.
							I was raised using a King James Version bible.  The one I choose to use now is the Restored Names King James Version, which keeps the text of the KJV while replacing the names with their correct Hebrew counterparts.  Unless otherwise referenced, all quotes from the Scriptures will be from the RNKJV.
							</p>
							<p>With that said, I do not condemn any believer who uses the more traditional names.  I was raised with the names, Lord, God and Jesus, and was saved and baptized in those names.  
							When I first was presented with this, I was troubled and sought out the Father to give me clarity.  When I asked, He told me, “It is not so much what they call me, as that they call me”.  He went on to say that He would respond to me if I continued to use the traditional names, but when I strove to use the proper Hebrew names, it showed a desire to have a more intimate relation with Him. He described it to me as “How would it be, if at an intimate time, a man should call out to his wife, using the name of an old girlfriend.”  Since that time, I strive to call Him by names that I know refer to Him and Him alone. </p>
							<p>I desire intimacy with my creator and that is why I use these names.  I mention them in this introduction, as this book is about the conversations I had with Him.  They were my conversations, so I (of course) used my terms.  I am explaining it here so that the reader will not be confused.</p>

							<h3>Hebrew</h3>
							<p>There are several Hebrew terms that I use throughout these conversations.  Besides the names, which I explained above I wanted to supply here, a mini-glossary of some of those terms.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Echad</li>
								<li>Satan</li>
								<li>Midrash</li>

							<h3>Scripture Verses</h3>
							<p>In reading this, you might think that I either have an encyclopedic knowledge of the Scriptures or that Yah gave me specific chapter and verses. Neither of these is true.  What actually happened was that Yah would give me enough of a verse, or the gist of its meaning; so that I could later look it up and provide it correctly within the conversation.

							<h3>Conersations</h3>
							<p>Within the text of these conversations I have used some conventions to try and make it clearer to the reader:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Items in Bold, are things which I felt I heard Yahuwah saying to me.</li>
								<li>Items in normal type are things I said to him.</li>
								<li>Items in Italics, are referential. They refer to what was happening within or about the conversation that was not necessarily part of the actual conversation.</li>
								<li>You may notice that the personal pronouns <b>You, My,</b> and <b>Me</b> are capitalized at what may seem inappropriate times.  When Yah is referring to Himself My and Me will be capitalized.  When I am referring to Him, You will be capitalized.  This is a matter of my personal desire to show respect to Him. It actually began as a natural inclination when typing out these conversations, so I took it as a sign from Him and continued that convention.</li>
							</ul>

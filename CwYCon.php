                            <h3>First Conversation</h3>
                            <p><i>While driving to work, I suddenly felt like Yahuwah was trying to say something to me.  I looked for something to write with, and managed to scribble what I was hearing onto some post-it notes. </i></p>
                            
                            <p class="left"><b>Adversity comes into your lives as a vehicle to bring you into a closer relationship with Me.</b></p>
                            
                            <p class="right">What do You mean by that?</p>
                            
                            <p class="left"><b>I will actually use the Adversary, Satan, to cause adversity in your lives, so that you will seek Me in overcoming them.</b></p>
                        
                            <p class="right">So, are You saying that Satan is not really such a bad guy after all?     
                            
                            <p class="left"><b>On the contrary, for he truly is.  Satan seeks to steal, kill, and destroy for his own pleasure.However, I use the Adversaryâ€™s innate nature to be the instigator of an adversity which I have arranged for your growth.
                            <br> I arrange this, in order to bring you back into a right relationship with Me.</b></p>

                            <p class="right">So, in essence, it sounds like You are using the principles set out in Romans 8:28.</p>

                            <blockquote><b>Romans 8:28</b></p> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love Yahuwah, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</p></blockquote>
                            
                            <p class="left"><b>Exactly. Unfortunately, most people have the wrong reaction to adversity. Instead of looking at themselves and how they need to strengthen their relationship with Me, their Father. They blame it on bad luck or let it sour their disposition toward the world and My creation.</b></p>
                            
                            <p class="right">If we are staying in right relationship with you, Yah, does that mean that Satan will not be allowed to bring adversity into our lives?</p>
                            
                            <p class="left"><b>Not necessarily so. When in right relationship, there is much less reason for you to go through those life lessons; but it is man's nature to be complacent, so there will always be reasons for My Plan to arrange some adversity, in order for you to continue to grow. </b></p>

                            <br>It looks like that word means "a hidden power believed to control what will happen in the future".</i></p>

                            <p class="right">That seems intriguing, can You tell more about this?</p>
                    
                            <p class="left"><b><i>Destiny</i> is related to <i>Prophecy</i>. Living out your Destiny while in right Relationship with Me is the fulfillment of My Prophecy for you.

                            <br>When you are walking in accord with Me, the things that I prophesy become <i>Destiny</i>.

                            <p class="left"><b>Atonement.</b></p>
                            
                            <p class="right">What about it?
                            <br> Stop thinking of it in the abstract. Look at its active components.
                            <br>To Atone is a verb which means to make amends, or to make changes for the better
                            <br>You need to seek to remove the bad (that which hinders your relationship with the Father) and build on the good (that which furthers your relationship with the Father)
                            <br>Atonement means to become more in touch with the Truth. Through understanding of that Truth, we can be reconciled with the Father.</p>
                            
                            <p><i>I thought it was strange that He would bring this up now, since we are approaching Pesach and not Yom Kippur, but I felt like he was saying that atonement is a daily process and not meant to be just once a year.</i></p>

                            <p><i>Yesterday, I neglected to take the opportunity to have my daily conversation with Yah. (was I really too busy for Yah)
                            <br>So, this morning, when starting my conversation I heard ... Silence.
                            <br>At first, I wasn't sure if my mind was saying "you're not hearing anything" or if that meant that Yah was saying "be silent so you can hear me"
                            <br>I finally decided that it was really both, that Yah was telling me that I was not hearing anything because I was not being silent enough. 
                            <br>I remembered how he had said that I had to prepare for my prayer time, so after a while I was able to get quiet enough to start to hear from Him. </i></p>

                            <p><i>I knew that I could not really do that while I was driving, so as soon as I stopped, I downloaded a version of the Bible that I could listen to on my phone. </i></p>

                            <p class="right">Am I being punished for that disobedience?</p>

                            <p><i>Somehow this gave me more insight of how I had let my ego get in the way on Sabbaths. Because of my lack of practice, I had allowed myself to feel ashamed to play in front of people.</i></p>

                            <br>Care for the present, for it is the foundation that your life is built upon.
